<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This post discusses the new language features of Java 8. Java 8's release is the most awaited and is a major feature
    release of Java programming language.</p>
<p>These new features include functional interfaces, interface default method, lambda expressions, method references,
    Optional, and Stream API. We will also talk about the new Data and Time API.</p>
<h3>Functional Interface</h3>
<p>Functional Interface is an interface with single abstract method (SAM). Static or the new default method is not
    counted. To indicate that an interface is a Functional Interface, annotation @FunctionalInterface on class level is
    needed. While an interface with SAM could still function as Functional Interface (qualified as lambda expression)
    even if it does not have such
    annotation (example is AWT's ActionListener), it is recommened that it be annotated.</p>
<p>Some old built-in interfaces with SAM, such as Comparator and Runnable, have been annotated with @FunctionalInterface
    and can be used as lambda expressions</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<script type="text/plain" class="language-java">
    @FunctionalInterface
	public interface Calculator {
	    double calculate(double x, double y);
	}
</script>
<h3>Lambda Expressions</h3>
<p>Lambda expressions encapsulate a single unit of behavior and pass it to other code. To be able to create lambda
    expression, you need first a Funtional Interface. This is the reason why a
    Functional Interface has a single abstract method. Instead of an anonymous class, lambda expression is a concise
    alternative and therefore shorthand replacement for it.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<script type="text/plain" class="language-java">
    parameter -> expression or statement body
</script>
<h4>Example</h4>
<script type="text/plain" class="language-java">
    (Integer x) -> { return x; };
</script>
<h4>Characteristics of Lambda Expression</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Optional type declaration<br>
        <script type="text/plain" class="language-java">
            (x) -> { return x; };
        </script>
    </li>
    <li>Optional parentheses<br>
        <script type="text/plain" class="language-java">
            x -> { return x; };
        </script>
        <p>Paretheses are required if there are multiple parameters. Parameters are separated by comma (,).</p>
        <script type="text/plain" class="language-java">
            (x, y) -> { return x + y; };
        </script>
    </li>
    <li>Optional curly braces ({}) and optional return keyword<br>
        <script type="text/plain" class="language-java">
            x -> x;
        </script>
        <p>Curly braces are required if body has multiple statements. return keyword is required for a function with
            return value if body has multiple statements. No return keyword is required if function does not return a
            value as in regular method.</p>
        <script type="text/plain" class="language-java">
                x -> {
                    System.out.println("Hello world!");
                    return x;
                };
            </script>
        <script type="text/plain" class="language-java">
                x -> {
                    System.out.println("Hello world!");
                    System.out.println("Welcome to Java 8 Programming!");
                };
            </script>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>To be continued...</p>
